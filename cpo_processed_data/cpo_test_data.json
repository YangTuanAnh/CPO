    "chosen": "The provided context does not directly assess the severity of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). However, the findings include no cortical atrophy and widening of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. These findings are not specific to GCA and would require further clinical evaluation to determine the severity of any underlying conditions.",
    "rejected": "Based on the absence of cortical atrophy, GCA appears to be mild. The lack of atrophy suggests that the inflammation associated with GCA has not caused significant damage to the brain tissue.",
